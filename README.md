[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JEFworks/brainmapr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JEFworks/brainmapr)

We developed `brainmapr` to the infer spatial location of neuronal subpopulations within the developing mouse brain by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns from the [Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas](http://mouse.brain-map.org/).

The `brainmapr` package comes pre-loaded with a small sample of ISH data for 38 genes in the embryonic 11.5 day old mouse. Additional ISH data for ~2000 genes in convenient RData formats are available for the embryonic 11.5, 13.5, 15.5, 16.5, and 18.5, and post-natal 4, 14, 28, and 56 day old mice and can be downloaded from the [Kharchenko lab website](http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/jean/brainmapr/data-raw/) due to file size limitations on GitHub. 

Please refer to the [Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas Documentation](http://help.brain-map.org/display/mousebrain/Documentation) for specific information on processes and procedures used to perform ISH, informatics data processing, structure annotation, and more.
