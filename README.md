#brainmapr

`brainmapr` visualizes and analyzes 3D ISH gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas. Our goal in developing `brainmapr` was to spatially place groups of neuronal cells within a region of the brain on interest based on their gene expression signatures identified from single cell RNA-seq.
